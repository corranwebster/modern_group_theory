These are a set of notes that I wrote for a course in group theory I taught at
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in the mid-2000s.  They are a little
incomplete, particularly towards the end of the course, and perhaps most
importantly I did not compile a bibliography as I went, so references are
lacking.

Hopefully someone may find these notes of use.
